              The Last Wish raid takes place in the Dreaming City, a mysterious realm within the Reef. 
              Here lies Riven, the last known Ahamkara, who has been Taken and corrupted. 
              The Guardians must navigate through the twisted reality of the Dreaming City to reach 
              Riven's heart and put an end to the corruption once and for all.

              <p><strong>Phases:</strong> Eye shooting, symbol callouts, elevator mechanics, and final DPS phase.</p>
              <p><strong>Note:</strong> This encounter can be "cheesed" with high DPS, but the legitimate clear is incredibly rewarding.</p>
